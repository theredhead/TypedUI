# TypedUI

TypedUI is a little frontend project that served as a test/study tool/proof of concept. Inspired by cappuccino (http://www.cappuccino-project.com/) I figured it shouldn't be too hard to build a small user interface library that would run exclusively in the browser.

I wondered how much code it would take to build something usable so I wrote this little proof of concept over the course of a weekend.

## Things this code does:

    1. present draggable, resizable windows.
    2. resize sub views in windows in several ways.

## things it does not do

    1. provide anything immediately useful
    2. present itself in an orderly fashion (it is just a test that was never intended to be an actual project)

## Purpose

This project is intended as a study tool, I do not recommend using it as anything more than that. 

## license

This code is written by me and I retain all rights to it. You are granted a non-exclusive unlimited license to use, modify and distribute this code at your own risk.

If this code is useful to you in any way, I'd love to know about it but you are not obligated to
